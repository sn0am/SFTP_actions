# SFTP_actions

SFTP_upload.py can be used to recursively upload all files and folders within a local directory to a remote directory. Folder structure is kept the same between local and remote files for the most part. 

Files that exist within the root local folder are placed in the 'Misc' remote folder, this name can be changed.
Files that exist within subfolders in the root local folder are placed within folders of the same name on the remote folder.
Only files that don't exist on the remote folder are uploaded, if no new files are detected in the local folder, upload is skipped.

SFTP_download.py can be used to recursively download all files and folders from a given remote folder.
Only files that don't exist within a local folder are downloaded. If no new files are detected, download is skipped.
