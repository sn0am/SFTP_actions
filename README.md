### SFTP_actions

# SFTP_functions.py
This file contains all of the functions utilized by 'SFTP_upload.py' and 'SFTP_download.py'.

# SFTP_upload.py 
This can be used to recursively upload all files and folders within a local directory to a remote directory. Folder structure is kept the same between local and remote files for the most part. 

* Files that exist within the root local folder are placed in the 'Misc' remote folder, this name can be changed.
* Files that exist within subfolders in the root local folder are placed within folders of the same name on the remote folder.
* Only files that don't exist on the remote folder are uploaded, if no new files are detected in the local folder, upload is skipped.


# SFTP_download.py 
* This can be used to recursively download all files and folders from a given remote folder.
Only files that don't exist within a local folder are downloaded. If no new files are detected, download is skipped.

# Note:
**These scripts were hastily written for home use, so the SFTP authentication function is not secure. If using this script for any other use case, I would recommend updating the SFTP authentication function.**
